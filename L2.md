* Set notation of asymptotic analysis.
* Pg 49,50 CLRS
* Big oh is same as <=
* Omega is same as >=
* Theta is equal to. Theta means both Big oh AND Omega true
* small oh and small omega notation.
* small oh is <
* small omega is >
* in these asymptotic notations, constant c, fucntions g(n) and f(n) are assumed positive. See CLRS
* Show that $\sqrt n = \Omega (\log n)$
* $ 2*n= o(n^2)$
* $ 2*n^2 \neq o(n^2)$. Doesn't hold when c=1
* small oh and small omega should be true for all constants c > 0. Big Oh and Big omega should be true for any positive c
* Methods to solve recurrence. Maybe none of them may work, need to try one at a time
- Substitution
  - Guess the solution.
  - Solve by induction.
  - Find constant terms
  - See some example in CLRS
  - Assignment questions.
    * Start with assumption $T(n)=c1*n^k-c2*n $ etc
- Recursion tree
- Master method
  - Only applies to equations of form-
    $T(n)=a*T(n/b)+f(n)$ where $a\geq	1$, $b>	1$ and $f(n)>0 \space\forall \space	n>n_0$
  - 3 cases
  - Check CLRS
  - does come in exam
* Divide and conquer
  - Divide into smaller subproblems
  - Conquer the subproblems recursively
  - Combine their solutions
* Binary Search
* Google divide and conquer vs dynamic programming
